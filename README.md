A camera for the AI era.

Images as primitive data source.

Dalle2, gpt-3.5-turbo, Nextjs, Microsoft Azure

Usage:
- Over time the system learns from previous prompts and makes suggestions that match the user's preferences
- The app can handle traditional interactions via a Web UI and programmatic calls to its API

To Do:

- Add context array and a messages table in an Azure db to retain context history / memory of previous prompts
- Add vector db for prompt embeddings
- (When available) add image embeddings to the vector db so the system develops a visual memory of previous images
- Find a way to combine these embeddings so the prompt embeddings and image embeddings can talk to each other
-
